# Issues Encountered
I had completed the lab portion a week prior, and since Dionaea appears to be an exceptionally popular honeypot, I had collected close to 4,000,000 samples, making the session file too large to work with and examine, as well as completely drowning out any data collected by other honeypots. 
To resolve this I decided to drop my mhn database collection and remove the dionaea honeypot. By doing this, I would have a smaller more manageable dataset that would contain a variety of data from different honeypots.
However, the downside to this approach was the fact that some honeypots are far more popular than others, so the dataset may be overpopulated by p0f and suricata attacks, and contain maybe 1-2 elastichoney attacks.
